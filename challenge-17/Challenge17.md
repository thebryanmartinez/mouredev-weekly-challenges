# Challenge 17 - The obstacle race

- âœ… Completed
- Difficulty: MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡

**Statement:** Create a function that evaluates if an athlete has successfully passed an obstacle race.

- The function will receive two parameters:

  - An array that can only contain String with the words "run" or "jump"
  - A String that represents the track and can only contain "\_" (floor) or "|" (fence)

- The function will print how the race finished:
- If the athlete "runs" on "\_" (ground) and "jumps" on "|" (fence) will be correct and will not vary the symbol for that part of the track.
- If you "jump" on "\_" (ground), the track will be varied by "x".
- If you do "run" in "|" (fence), the track will be varied by "/".
- The function will return a Boolean that indicates if it has passed the race.
- To do this you have to make the correct option in each section of the track.
