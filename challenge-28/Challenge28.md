# Challenge 28 - Vending machine

- ❌ Not completed
- Difficulty: MEDIUM 🟡

**Statement:** Simulate the operation of a vending machine by creating an operation that receives money (array of coins) and a number that indicates the selection of the product.

- The program will return the name of the product and an array with the money returned (with the smallest number of coins).
- If the money is insufficient or the product number does not exist, it must be indicated with a message and return all coins.
- If there is no money back, the array will be returned empty.
- For simplicity, we will work in cents with 5, 10, 50, 100 and 200 coins.
- We must control that the currencies sent are within those supported.
